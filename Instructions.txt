1. PREREQUISITES:

    1) Go to Chrome and type 'chrome://version/' in the address bar and see the version of chrome you're running
    2) Next goto 'https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html' and find the folder having the name that corresponds to your version of chrome and download the driver for your OS
    3) Move the folder into the same folder where the 'bot' folder lives
    4) Go to the 'grammarly' folder inside the 'bot' folder and open 'constants.py' put the location of the chrome driver in the PATH_TO_CHROME_DRIVER variable
    5) Go to the 'onetext' folder inside the 'bot' folder and open 'constants.py' put the location of the chrome driver in the PATH_TO_CHROME_DRIVER variable as well

2. SETTING ALL THE ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS:

        1) Goto the 'grammarly' folder and open 'secretConst.py' file
        2) In variables ACC_EMAIL and ACC_PASSWORD, write your Grammarly FREE account email and password respectively

    b. 1Text part:

3. GETTING ALL THE API KEYS FOR GOOGLE SPREADSHEET:

    1) goto 'https://console.developers.google.com/' and use a Google account which you will be using to store the spreadsheet file
    2) In the top navbar, you will be able to see a button to 'Create a project'. Go there and create a project naming whatever you like
    3) After that, goto 'https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library' and in the search bar, type "Google drive" and enable the API that says google drive. Click on it and then "Enable"
    4) And then under Google drive API find 'Create Credential' and click on it. This will ask a few questions.
    5) When it asks "What data will you be using", choose "Application Data" and answer the subsequent questions
    6) After all the setup there should be a "Credentials" tab in the left side. Click on it and go to the 'Keys' tab and click on "Add Key" and then 'new key'
    7) This will have downloaded a JSON file in your downloads. Move the file to the 'spreadsheet' folder under the 'bot' folder and name it 'secret_key2.json'
    8) Now opn the 'spreadsheet2.py' file and in place of <PATH TO SECRET_KEY FILE> put the full location of the secret_key2.py along with it's name
    9) Go back to 'https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library' and search for "Google sheets" and click on enable
